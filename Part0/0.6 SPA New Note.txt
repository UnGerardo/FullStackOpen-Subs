The following happens when a new note is added to the SPA version of the notes app:

(New note is submitted)
- JS takes input and creates a new note object with the data and creates a new Date object
- JS pushes new note object to local variable "notes" which has the previous notes recieved from the server
- input box is cleared of the previous data (reset to being empty)
- Old ul of notes is removed and new ul of notes is created and added to the DOM
- new note is sent to server

browser -> server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server --> browser: Responds with the message "note created"

note over browser:
browser sends the new note in JSON format along with a the time it was created
end note
